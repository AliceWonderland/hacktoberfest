# Andrea Zanin
## Who am I?
I am an italian high school student passionate about math, programming, open source and peer-teaching. After playing around with many different languages I settled with JavaScript, as I find it to be one of the most flexible languages out there: you can do functional, object oriented, reactive (ReactJS), front-end, back-end (node), native (electron, React Native) programming. I find that to be extremely useful in developing side-projects, that often require you to be full stack.

## Open Source you say?
I published some modules to work with React and Electron:
- [react draggable tabs](https://github.com/ZaninAndrea/react-draggable-tabs): atom-like tabs in react

- [react fluid buttons](https://github.com/ZaninAndrea/react-fluid-buttons): nifty button hover highlighting that slides from a button to another
- [yeoman generator react electron](https://github.com/ZaninAndrea/generator-react-electron): fully fledged yeoman generator to create an electron+react app with automatic update delivery, sass, hot reloading,...

## Peer-teaching you say?
I only recently started publishing tutorials online, also because of a bit of self-consciousness about my english (I am from Italy <3). Still I have created a minicourse on [functional programming in JS](https://tech.io/playgrounds/2980/practical-introduction-to-functional-programming-with-js/pure-functions).  
More stuff coming soon on Medium ;)
