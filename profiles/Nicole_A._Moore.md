### Learned Git for Windows by writing a graphic novel (The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) / The Matrix (1999)) out of code because it intrigued me that, while jacked into the Jump Program, Peter would simply scale the building afar instead of falling to his 'death'.  It was using this project in my original Github account (github.com/Angelfirenze) that I originally learned Git for Windows.
