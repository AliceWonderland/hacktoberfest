### Development

- I try to learn as much coding as I can, but work sometimes tires me alot, eventually I decided to just 
learn creative things like youtube or twitch so I can grow my content, hopefully I'll add more projects
that are related to coding.

### Projects

- [My Twitch](https://twitch.tv/JHeroGR) Currently growing my Twitch channel to be as good of a content 
creator as I can be.
- [My Youtube](https://youtube.com/JHero) Working on my Youtube channel to be a Go-To lets player with
games I enjoy and the audience enjoys.
