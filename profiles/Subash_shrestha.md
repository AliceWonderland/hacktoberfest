### Location

Karlsruhe, Germany

### About Me

I am a JS engineer and I have experience in building mobile apps and websites. I love to follow the latest trends and keep myself busy sharpening my skills..

I have more than 4 years of experience in development in an outsourcing company which gave me an insight into this development field.

### Besides Coding
Besides coding and all, I am Tech Youtuber. I love to talk about new technologies and put my views on new trends. Also, I was a data science teacher in my country. Currently, I was into the crypto coins and blockchain in the early 2010s but it was banned in my country so I had to leave that field.
