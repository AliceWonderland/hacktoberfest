# Angelo Souza

### Location

Sorocaba, SP - Brazil

### Academics

I'm studying computer science at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos, and I almost graduated, yeah!!!

### Interests

- I really love code and make music. Now I'm finishing my studies, maybe it's time to join these passions

### Development

- I'm working with Python at this moment, but I have work with NodeJS already and I confess, I loved it. I miss my `consts` and `lets`, but Python looks like a great programming language too, so it's OK. I think the most important thing it's to continue to code.
