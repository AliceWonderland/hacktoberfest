### Development

I have created several repositories, but the one I have worked on the most is a social network, which at the beginning I programmed in **vanilla JavaScript, html and css**, then I refactored it with **React** _(for this project I used Create-react-app)_ where I transformed all the sections in components and make a simpler and cleaner logic, currently the app can add new images, edit the name and about of the profile, delete cards and send requests to the APIs without generating errors.

### Projects
