- [Atom plugin](https://github.com/kim-codes/kims-dictionary-plugin) 
This repository contains the contents for a tutorial on creating an Atom plugin. The plugin implements the functionality of a basic dictionary lookup. A user can look up a word directly in the editor, by either highlighting the word or placing the cursor somewhere in the word.
