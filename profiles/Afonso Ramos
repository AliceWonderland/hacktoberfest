# Afonso Ramos
### Location

Porto, Portugal

### Academics

Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto

### Interests

A lot of people often just start by describing their hobbies, but one thing I really like is talking, listening to others, being helpful.

Past that, I also like gaming, gardening and drinking good beer.

### Development

I am still a student, currently taking a Masters in Computer Engineering, however, I have developed a lot of projets both within the course as well as outside it.
Currently I am the IEEE University of Porto Student Branch Vice-Chair and I am a heavy contributor to the community.
