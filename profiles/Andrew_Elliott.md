# Andrew Elliott

### Location

Nashville Tn, USA

### Academics

I'm a self-taught developer, but I studied via sites like pluralsight, freecodecamp and teamtreehouse!

### Interests

- I'm an avid nerd, so hobbies like Magic the Gathering, playing Xbox or WoW are my go tos

### Development

- I'm a Front End Dev, so languages such as React, PHP and basic HTML/CSS are my bread and butter

### Projects

- [Marvel Search Engine](https://github.com/Critchkn/marvel-search-portal) Once of the coolest things I've made, and the one I'm most proud of is my <a href="https://marvel-search-portal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html">marvel search engine</a>!
