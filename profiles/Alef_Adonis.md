- [Game Life is Hard Trissie](https://github.com/AlefAdonis/first_game) 
  It's a choice's game where you control a woman and you have to decide 
  crucial, decisive and, sometimes, romantic ways of her life. The game is
  indicated for +15 years and it's all in Portuguese(my native language).
  The game was made on Python, so it's very simple!
