## About me:

I’m a 16 year old student from Sopron, Hungary. I do app/web development and design. I mostly work on personal projects, but I also do freelance work. I’ve been interested in programming since I was 9 and I’ve got into app development 3 years ago. My passion has not stopped ever since. I spend all my freetime and holidays working on projects and learning new programming languages and technologies. I also love doing photography, motion graphics, running and video editing.
