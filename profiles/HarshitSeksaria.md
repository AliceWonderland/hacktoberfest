# Harshit Seksaria (aka DudeCoder)

### Bio

Hello, My name is Harshit Seksaria.
I'm an Enthusiastic Android Developer and a Geek!

Well, I'm playing with machines since 2012, I became a Programmer in 2014 and `c` as my first programming language. I spend a lot of time with c, even I'd a messenger with that.

Then I moved to `java` and `python`. And I learnt a little bit of `Web Development` too.
But still my hunger was not satisfied.
Further I learnt `Android Development`, `javascript` and `kotlin` too.

Then I came to know that `Android Development` is what I was looking for.

I'm a Student right now. But my interest in programming made me a good programmer.
I know `Android Development`, Web Development, `c`, `c++`, `python`(Including `django`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`), `java`, `javascript`, `kotlin`, `html`, `css`, `xml`, `firebase`.

My Favorite Language is `kotlin`, That's Amazing.

Although, I have great experience in `c` Programming Language.
Right now, I use only `kotlin`, `java` and a little bit `python` too.
I spend most of the time in `Android development` and in learning new things.
