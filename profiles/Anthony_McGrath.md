### Bio

I am an experienced Full Stack Developer, with a history of working in a variety of environments from small to large scale. With a creative background, I bring a creative element to my code, which is evidenced most strongly in the lateral thinking I use with my approach to problem solving. 

I have a history of working both in the front end, and back end, doing everything from creating real world versions of static PDF, PSD, or Fireworks PNG designs for clients, to building back end data structures and processes for handling, formatting, securing, and serving data. 

I am experienced in both Procedural and Object Oriented programming methodologies, and quickly pick up most things. I usually only need to be told something once or twice in order to understand it, and I swiftly gain in depth knowledge of new concepts to the point that I am often able to then assist others in the learning and understanding of difficult new concepts. 

I love to see others flourish and grow, and am generous with my time and knowledge to aid in their growth. I strongly believe in the power of teamwork and collaboration in order to create amazing things, and connect quite strongly with Agile principles. 

I aspire to join a diverse and inclusive team, where personal and professional growth and improvement are a way of life. I want to be part of a team that will invest in my growth and that will allow me to contribute back to the team, by aiding in the growth of my colleagues, and by getting stuck in to all areas of the stack.
