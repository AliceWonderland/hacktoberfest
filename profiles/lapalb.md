- [Self driving Car using Q Learning](https://github.com/lapalb/Self-Driving-Car) 
I along with my team built our own self-driving car. It was a modelled version of a
car (so it wasnâ€™t driving on the streets of real cities) but still - it learned how to drive
itself. We used Open source car model which was developed in Unity game engine. We
trained it using the pioneering research paper of Nvidia. To achieve this, we used deep
Q-Learning.
