### Projects

- [Cricket Shots Classification](https://github.com/raushanraj358/Cricket-Shots-Classification) Developed a SoftMax based convolutional neural network and a SVM based convolutional neural network for classification of cricket shots. Later, I have comapred the performance of both models using different metrics. There was an existing shotnet model whose accuracy was below 80%. I have upgraded that existing model with completely different techniques, which gives me an accuracy of 92.2%(more than 90% on an average).
