## About me 

An ordinary person figuring out and fighting against time slowly making the impending doom approach. <img align=right src='https://media.tenor.com/k8A7cVerS1UAAAAj/touhou-fumo.gif'>

Full time GNU/Linux user that is fortunately **not a femboy**. You're welcome.  
Prefers CLI over GUI for general purposes. 

Exercises instead of sitting on chair in the loading screen. 

Procrastinates until the limit and still doesn't mess up stuff. 

I generally put meme references over my work as a sign of existence. 

### Interests 
- Messing with computers <img align=right src='https://media.tenor.com/AGB-hxBtr1QAAAAi/moriya-suwako.gif' width=150>
- Blowing up operating systems 
- Ricing machines 
- Landscape photography 
- Firearm maintenance 

## My word to live by

*CLI is like sex, you `git gud` in it over time.*
