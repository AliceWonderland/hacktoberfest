### Academics

Computer Science, GGSIPU (New Delhi, India)

### Bio

My coding journey began with C++, which helped me grasp fundamental concepts of programming. Web Dev was next. Few months after that, I was introduced to the world of ML/AI. I'm still in awe!!
I'm fascinated by Deep Learning and Computer Vision and the fusion of the two.

### Interests

- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- AI Research
- Listening to music

### Projects

- [IMAGE OBJECTS DETECTION PWA](https://objectdetector77.netlify.com/) Recognizes about 80 daily-life objects like person, bike, bags, couch, plants, etc. from images using deep learning model trained on COCO dataset.
Entire frontend is responsive and built with React.
The images are processed on server-side and sent back as API response.
The API is built with Flask served by Gunicorn WSGI server and deployed to Heroku.


- [ARISTIC STYLE TRANSFER (PYTORCH)](https://github.com/varnitmittal/Artistic-Style-Transfer-PyTorch/) Simple PyTorch code for artistic style transfer in images using pretrained VGG-19 convolution network (as feature extractor).


- [FACE DETECTION IN VIDEO FILES](https://github.com/varnitmittal/Facial-Recognition/) Simple OpenCV code to detect faces and eyes in video streams with the help of Haar Cascades. The processed video is saved as an avi video file. The code is meant for processing video files, but with some minor changes, it can be used to detect faces (and eyes) in live video streams and/or images.


- [VALOUR: USER AUTHENTICATION & DASHBOARD WEB APP](htpps://valour77.herokuapp.com/) Minimal full-stack MERN web application with user authentication and interactive dashboard, powered by highly secure MongoDB database, with dual encryption of users' sensitive data like passwords. Entire front end is built on React and is cross-platform and responsive across a variety of devices.
The purpose of this project was to build a PWA that would act as boilerplate for full-stack developers.
