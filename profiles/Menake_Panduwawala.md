Dec 2020 ‚Äì Apr 2021
Project descriptionCBSL has recognized the need to implement a comprehensive cross border transactions and foreign currency transactions monitoring system through LCBs, LSBs and Restricted Dealers (RDs) of foreign currency as a key initiative in the Strategic Plan of CBSL. The project was proposed as a new Strategic Priority of at the Strategic Planning Retreat in 2018 by the Economic Research Department (ERD), and the progress of the same was presented at the Strategic Planning Retreat in 2019. Accordingly, ERD would serve as the lead department with the support of Department of Foreign Exchange (DFE), Information Technology Department (ITD), Bank Supervision Department (BSD), and other relevant departments of CBSL.
The proposed system, commonly known as ITRS, is a data collection system adopted by many central banks to obtain data from banks at the level of individual transactions. Data from an ITRS mainly consist of transaction- wise data on all cross-border transactions made by customers of LCBs, LSBs and RDs (referred to as ‚Äòbanks‚Äô hereafter) and domestic
transfers between foreign currency accounts, deposits and withdrawals from foreign currency accounts of the banking system. For each cross-border transaction, the ITRS is used to obtain data on the value and the purpose of the transaction, transaction currency, name of beneficiary (local recipient for inward flow or foreign recipient of outward flow), name of ordering customer (foreign sender for inward flow or local sender for outward flow) and relationship with beneficiary (ex: creditor/ debtor)), among others.
