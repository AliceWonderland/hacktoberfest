Fibonacci Sequence in C++

```C++
// Enter the limit.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    
  int input;  
  std::cin >> input;  
  std::cout << "Limit: " << input << std::endl;
  int first_number = 0, second_number = 1, third_number = 1;
  std::cout << "The Fibonacci sequence is: "  << first_number << " " << second_number << " ";
  
  while (first_number + second_number < input) {
    third_number = first_number + second_number;
    first_number = second_number;      
    second_number = third_number;
    std::cout << third_number << " ";
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
