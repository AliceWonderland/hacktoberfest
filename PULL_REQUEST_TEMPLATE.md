# Hello and Welcome!

Thank you for contributing to the hacktoberfest. Please take some time to make sure your PR is inline with all of the following requirements.

### If you are submitting a script file:

Your ending script file should look something like this:
```
// LANGUAGE: Javascript
// ENV: Node.js
// AUTHOR: Steven Copeland
// GITHUB: https://github.com/StevenCopeland

console.log("Hello World") 
```
DO NOT make your file like this:
```
console.log("Hello World")
```
Also, make sure to put the file in the script folder, NOT in the home directory.

### If you are submitting a new contributor:

Your data should look some what like this:

```
 #### Name: [YOUR NAME](GitHub Link)
  - Place: City, State, Country
  - Bio: Who are you?
  - GitHub: [Your Name](GitHub Link)
```

### If you are submitting a profile:

Make sure to include your file in the Profile directory, NOT(as I said before) in the home directory.

Your data should look somewhat like this:

```
