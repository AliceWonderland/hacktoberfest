Some of the Best Ethereum Wallets are:
1. Trezor One
Trezor is the oldest Bitcoin hardware wallet. It is a product of SatoshiLabs and has a straightforward interface. In terms of security, Trezor is quite advanced as its PIN code never leaves the wallet. This means even if you connect it with a compromised computer, you won’t face the risk of compromising your wallet. Some argue it’s the best Ethereum wallet in the market. 

Main Highlight

The primary highlight of Trezor One is its security. Its PIN code system ensures that brute-force entering is impossible. When you enter the PIN code incorrectly, it increases the waiting time by a power of two. For example, it’ll take 17 years to make 30 guesses. 

Whenever you connect your wallet to your computer, it’ll ask you to enter the PIN. Trezor generates a random PIN code every time, and it’ll display one when you connect it to the computer. After entering the PIN, you’d have to enter the passphrase, which only you’re aware of. 

Additional Features
Trezor One supports multiple cryptocurrencies (more than a thousand, actually) such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum Classic, etc. 

However, Trezor doesn’t support Ripple, Monero, Cardano, and Tezos. It is compatible with Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.

2. Metamask
If you don’t know much about the Ethereum network, you should go with this option. Metamask is a software that you can download as a Chrome extension too! Your Ethereum wallet remains available on your browser with Metamask, and if you’re a developer, you can interact with Ethereum test networks through it as well. 

Main Highlight
Metamask provides an abstraction to its users, thus lowering the entry barrier for many people interested in Ethereum. With Metamask, you can access Ethereum dApps through your browser. Apart from that, you can easily switch between the leading network and a test network too. 

Additional Features
Your private keys have password encryption with Metamask and remain stored on your machine to export whenever you require. Another highlight of this wallet is you don’t have to download a full Ethereum node to use it. With Metamask, you can manage multiple wallets from one place. However, you should know that it’s not as secure as a hardware wallet or a paper one.
